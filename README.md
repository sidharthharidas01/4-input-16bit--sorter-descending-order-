# 4-input-16bit--sorter-descending-order-
4 input each of 16bit are sorted in descending order
**Structural modelling used**
Largest of the 4 inputs are found out using 6 comparators and is given to 1st output port.

The now found out largest no. is then ommited using the 4 to 3 reduction module and the largest of the rest of the 3 inputs is found using similar method as above case.
This is then given to the 2nd output port
The 2nd largest input is then removed and the rest two  are compared and sorted.
